# 🌳 Project README: Sustainability Dashboard Analysis

---

### 1. Overview 🌐

This document serves as the **README** for the **Sustainability Project**, an analytical tool developed in Microsoft Excel. The project is designed to provide comprehensive insights into various aspects of **product sustainability, environmental impact, and market trends**. The core of the project is a set of interactive dashboards that visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) to aid in data-driven decision-making regarding sustainability initiatives.

### 2. Objectives ✨

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* **Benchmark Performance:** 📈 Track and evaluate the company's sustainability trajectory over time, particularly in relation to cost and overall rating.
* **Identify High-Impact Areas:** 🎯 Highlight the top categories in terms of sustainability rating, water usage, and carbon footprint.
* **Optimize Product Strategy:** 💡 Determine which product categories offer the best value (price vs. sustainability) and identify material choices that are most water-intensive.
* **Analyze Market and Regional Trends:** 🗺️ Investigate the impact of various certifications, assess the growth of the "green" market, and compare regional performance in sustainability and waste production.
* **Segment Audience Impact:** 👤 Determine which target audience contributes to the highest carbon footprint.

### 3. Dashboard Breakdown 📊

The project features two main analytical dashboards:

| **Water Drainage Analysis** | Highlights the top 10 products that deplete water resources. |
| **Material Water-Intensity** | Compares the water usage of different raw materials. |
| **Carbon Footprint by Audience** | Shows which target audience has the highest carbon footprint. |
| **Sustainability Rating Breakdown** | Distribution across Fully, Partially, and Not Sustainable ratings. |

#### Dashboard 2: Market, Regional & Certification Analysis 🌍

| Visualization | Key Insight |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Certification Impact** | Analyzes the difference various certifications make in reducing waste. |
| **Regional Sustainability** | Compares regions on average carbon footprint and water usage. |

### 4. Usage and Maintenance ⚙️

#### How to Use:

1.  📂 Open the **"Sustainability project"** Excel file.
2.  ➡️ Navigate between **'Dashboard 1'** and **'Dashboard 2'** tabs.
3.  🖱️ Use the **Slicers** (left panel) to dynamically filter all visualizations based on **Region, Country, Year,** etc.
4.  🧠 Interpret the updated charts and KPIs to derive insights.

#### Maintenance:

* **Data Refresh:** 🔄 Use **'Data Streamer'** or **'Power Pivot'** to refresh the data connection if the source is external.
* **Update:** ➕ Integrate new data entries into the source tables and ensure PivotTable ranges are updated.
* **Formulas:** ✔️ Review formulas and data connections periodically for data integrity.
